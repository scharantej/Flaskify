 ## Python Flask Expert Assistant

### Problem Analysis
Based on your description of the problem, I have identified the following key points:

- You want to create a simple web application using Python Flask to display a list of items.
- Each item should have a name, description, and price.
- Users should be able to view the list of items and click on an item to see its details.

### Flask Application Design

To solve this problem, I propose a Flask application with the following structure:

**HTML Files:**

1. `index.html`: This will be the main page of the application. It will display a list of items with their names and prices.
2. `item_details.html`: This page will display the details of a specific item, including its name, description, and price.

**Routes:**

1. `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page.
2. `/item/<item_id>`: This route will render the `item_details.html` page for the specified item.

### Implementation Details

Here are some additional details about the implementation of the application:

- The list of items will be stored in a Python list or dictionary.
- The `index.html` page will use a loop to iterate over the list of items and display their names and prices.
- The `item_details.html` page will use the `item_id` parameter to retrieve the details of the specified item from the list.

### Conclusion

This Flask application design provides a simple and effective solution to the problem you described. It uses basic Flask features and is easy to implement.
